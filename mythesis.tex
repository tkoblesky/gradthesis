\abstract{\OnePageChapter	% because it is very short	
Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP) is a new state of matter created in science laboratories that is thought to be the same as the universe approximately one microsecond after the big bang. QGP is a hot and dense state of matter where quarks are not confined into hadrons. In Au+Au collisions at \sqsn = 200 GeV at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and Pb+Pb collisions at \sqsn = 2.76 TeV at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), QGP has been observed to have unique properties such as its opacity to color charges and that it behaves like a near-perfect fluid. Evidence of a near-perfect fluid have been observed such as substantial azimuthal anisotropy in the momentum distribution of final state particles which indicates a strongly-coupled, locally-equilibrated, hydrodynamic flowing medium. Recently, features of collectivity have been observed in high-multiplicity small collision systems thought to be too small to produce QGP such as $\hau$ and $\dau$ at \sqsn = 200 GeV, $p+Pb$ at \sqsn = 5 TeV, and even in $p+p$ at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV events. In order to constrain models seeking to describe this behavior, collision systems with distinct initial collision geometries were run at RHICk: $\hau$ for triangular geometry, $\dau$ for elliptical geometry, and $\pau$ for circular geometry. This thesis is the completion of that set of three measurements, by measuring $v_2$ in the p+Au.
