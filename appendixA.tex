\chapter{$v_2(\pt)$ with Different $\Psi_2$ Weighting}	% *NOT* \OnePageChapter
\label{sec:appendix}
In this appendix, we show the $v_2(\pt)$ measurement with the FVTXS and BBCS event plane with various corrections which are described in Chapter 4. We show $v_2(\pt)$ for each layer of the FVTX and each ring of the BBC separately.
