\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {1.1}{\ignorespaces A diagram demonstrating the relation between initial state geometry being transformed into final state momentum anisotropy. The left depicts two spherical nuclei colliding parallel to the z-axis. The pair of nuclei leave behind ellipsoid corresponding to the almond-shaped elliptical overlap region present in the initial state collision geometry. This ellipsoid hydrodynamically evolves such that it expands along the steepest pressure gradient which corresponds to the transverse (x-y plane). The right depicts the elliptical pattern present in transverse momentum distribution of the final state particles after the medium has finished evolving.}}{2}{figure.1.1}
\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {1.2}{\ignorespaces A diagram of the possible initial conditions of heavy ion collisions. The impact parameter is the red line.
