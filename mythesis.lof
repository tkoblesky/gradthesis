\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {1.1}{\ignorespaces A diagram demonstrating the relation between initial state geometry being transformed into final state momentum anisotropy. The left depicts two spherical nuclei colliding parallel to the z-axis. The pair of nuclei leave behind ellipsoid corresponding to the almond-shaped elliptical overlap region present in the initial state collision geometry. This ellipsoid hydrodynamically evolves such that it expands along the steepest pressure gradient which corresponds to the transverse (x-y plane). The right depicts the elliptical pattern present in transverse momentum distribution of the final state particles after the medium has finished evolving.}}{2}{figure.1.1}

The 1-D two-particle correlation function is a projection in $0.8 < |\Delta \eta | < 1.8$ from the 2-D correlation function, the 2-D correlation function being similar to that of the right panel of Figure \ref {fig:corr_function_example}. The black dotted points are the values of the correlation function and the colored lines are the first five $\qopname \relax o{cos}$ Fourier decomposition components. The black dotted line is the sum of these five components. \textbf {add ref}.}}{7}{figure.1.4}

The spectators are the nucleons which do not participate in the collision, as opposed to the participants which do participate in the collision.
