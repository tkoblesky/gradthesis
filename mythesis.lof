The results are with input parameters $\eta $/s = 1/4$\pi $ and initial Gaussian smearing $\sigma $ = 0.4 fm and a freeze-out temperatures of $T_F$ = 150 MeV. Diagrams of two possible d+Au initial configurations are overlayed on top of the plot. Increasing distance between the two d+Au nucleons correspond to a larger $\epsilon _2$.\textbf {add ref}}}{9}{figure.1.7}
