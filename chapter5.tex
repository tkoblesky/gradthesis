\section{$v_2$ Measurement}
The resulting $v_2$ measurement for p+Au @ $\sqrt{s}$ 200 GeV $0-5\%$ centrality shown in \ref{fig:pau_points_alone}. There is a significant $v_2$, even in a small system such as p+Au.

\section{Comparison with Other Species}
We can compare the p+Au $v_2$ measurement compared to d+Au
[add ref] %~\cite{Adare:2014keg} 
and He+Au
%~\cite{Adare:2015ctn} 
[add ref]
in the same $0\%-5\%$ centrality class, is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:all_system_hydro}. The d+Au data, as presented in Ref.
%~\cite{Adare:2014keg}
[add ref], did not include non-flow contributions in its systematic uncertainties, which are now accounted for in the systematics shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:all_system_hydro}. In all cases, there is a substantial $v_2$ that rises with $p_T$. It is notable that the $v_2$ values for d+Au and He+Au are consistent within uncertainties, as are their eccentricities $\varepsilon_2$ listed in Table \ref{table_geometry_glasma}. The p+Au collisions have a significantly lower $v_2$ and a correspondingly lower calculated $\varepsilon_2$. At the same time, the ordering of $v_2$ from p+Au, to d+Au, to He+Au also follows the expected increasing order of particle multiplicity. In the case of d+Au and He+Au, for the $0\%-5\%$ most central events, the published values for midrapidity charged particle density are $dN_{ch}/d\eta$ = 20.8 $\pm$ 1.5 and 26.3 $\pm$ 1.8, respectively
%~\cite{Adare:2015bua}
[add ref]. This quantity has not yet been measured in p+Au collisions.

\subsection{SONIC}
Also shown in Fig. ~\ref{fig:all_system_hydro} are $v_2$ calculations for each system from the \textsc{sonic} hydrodynamic model~\cite{Habich:2014jna}, which incorporates standard Monte Carlo Glauber initial conditions followed by viscous hydrodynamics with $\eta/s=0.08$, and a transition to a  hadronic cascade at $T=$ 170 MeV. It is notable that these calculations for each system are matched to the charged particle density at midrapidity, with the exact values for $0\%-5\%$ centrality of 10.0, 20.0, and 27.0, for p+Au, d+Au, and He+Au collisions, respectively~\cite{Habich:2014jna}. Again, note that $dN_{cn}/d\eta$ has not been measured for p+Au, and that the value of 10.0 was extrapolated from measurements in the other two systems~\cite{Habich:2014jna}. We thus see that the calculation includes both the geometry-related change in eccentricity and the relative collision multiplicity. In all cases, a good agreement is seen within uncertainties between the data and the calculation. These observations strongly support the notion of initial geometry, coupled to the hydrodynamic evolution of the medium as a valid framework to understand small system collectivity.
