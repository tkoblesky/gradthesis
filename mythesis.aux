The PMTs are separated by color which corresponds to rings of approximate common radius as shown in Fig \ref {fig:bbc_rings}. The left plot shows near uniformity as a function of $\phi $ and ring. However, the right plot shows a significant deviation from uniformity especially for the innermost rings (rings 1 and 2) there is. In addition to the $\phi $ variation for the right plot, the innermost rings have the largest average charge when compared to the other rings. This is in part due to the fact the inner most rings cover the a slightly larger $\eta $ range. However, the innermost rings in the left plot also cover the largest $\eta $ range and do not exhibit this separation in rings}{figure.1.18}{}}
